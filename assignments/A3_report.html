            <h2>Phase One: Sketches</h2>
            <p>
                The question I wanted to answer is: did women live longer than men in 2000? How about in 1900?
            </p>
            <h3>Age Pyramid</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/a3_age_pyramid.jpeg" width="100%" alt="age pyramid" />
                <figcaption>

            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The vertical line down the middle suggests (alludes) that there should be
                    symmetry between the two sides, and thus the classic age pyramid graphic allows viewers to spot the
                    difference between the two sides easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The shape of various pyramids are recognized, culturally, perhaps due to American social science
                    classes raising concerns about aging societies like those of Japan. Likewise, the two age pyramids
                    can give a picture of how different the two snapshots of America are, almost like two different
                    countries.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Seniors in 2000 Pie Chart</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/a3_pie_chart.jpeg" width="100%" alt="pie chart" />
                <figcaption>
                    U.S. Senior Population (65+) in Year 2000
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pie charts capture proportions of a whole better than bar charts. Thus, this figure emphasizes
                    comparison BETWEEN the sexes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I chose the partition of 65+ to define the senior retirement age population of America, which is in
                    many systemic ways how America defines "old."
                </li>
                <li>
                    I chose to use degrees instead of area to divide the pie pieces to meet standard use, as discussed
                    in class.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Age Distribution in 1900 vs. 2000</h3>

                    Age Distribution in 1900 vs. 2000
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I wanted to capture the movement of distribution over time better. I imagined that a gif over time
                    could move the 1900 "mountain" to meet the one of "2000".
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Overall</h3>

            <p>
                The three different visualizations target different focuses: whether the age distribution for men and
                women are symmetric, what the percentage of the senior population is made of women, and how women
                contributed to the shift in total age distribution over the two time instants. All three visualizations
                used size (either area or degree) to show the difference between the number of sexes. Only the last
                visualization integrates time in the visualization. All three visualizations deal with the challenge
                of coloring the genders (going against the pink and blue binary that has held throughout time).

            <figure>
                <video width="100%" controls>

                    Population of Female and Male by Age Groups in the United States in Year 2000 (Orange: Female,
                    Purple: Male)
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                This figure responds to the original question: did women live longer than men in 2000? The eye can track
                the difference between the number and ratio of women to men in the different age groups. The
                slider/video allows viewers to see the pie slice grow and take up more of the total pie as the age grows
                from 0 to 90.
            </p>

            <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dimensions: I wanted to express the sex ratio and number in the different age groups,
                    which required data in three dimensions. Instead of using three spatial dimensions, I used a
                    pie-chart and slider: where I used angle of pie slices for sex ratio, size of pie for total
                    population size, and the slider to go through the age group bins from (0 to 90). Ideally, the slider
                    would be interactive in the html report.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Genderized Visual Perception: I kept consistent with the color choices in Phase One, using orange
                    and purple to represent Female and Male sex. However, I couldn't find a way to relabel the legend
                    that has Male as 1 and Female as 2, which is consistent to today's male-centric standardizations.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase One -> Phase Two</h3>
            <p>
                Figure 4 from Phase Two takes advantage of the digital interactivity of the computer vs. the paper by
                adding the time/slider dimension. But otherwise, it takes most of its form from Figure 3 of Phase One.
                By capturing the change in the age group, and not just aggregating the whole of the senior population,
                Figure 4. illuminates more trends in the dimension of age groups: for example that the percentage of
                women starts overtaking that of men as early as age group 35 and starts growing slowly until age group
                90.
