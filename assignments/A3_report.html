            <h2>Phase One: Sketches</h2>

            <h3>Age Pyramid</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/a3_age_pyramid.jpeg" width="100%" alt="age pyramid" />
                <figcaption>

            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The vertical line down the middle suggests (alludes) that there should be
                    symmetry between the two sides, and thus the classic age pyramid graphic allows viewers to spot the
                    difference between the two sides easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The shape of various pyramids are recognized, culturally, perhaps due to American social science
                    classes raising concerns about aging societies like those of Japan. Likewise, the two age pyramids
                    can give a picture of how different the two snapshots of America are, almost like two different
                    countries.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Seniors in 2000 Pie Chart</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/a3_pie_chart.jpeg" width="100%" alt="pie chart" />
                <figcaption>
                    U.S. Senior Population (65+) in Year 2000
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pie charts capture proportions of a whole better than bar charts. Thus, this figure emphasizes
                    comparison BETWEEN the sexes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I chose the partition of 65+ to define the senior retirement age population of America, which is in
                    many systemic ways how America defines "old."
                </li>
                <li>
                    I chose to use degrees instead of area to divide the pie pieces to meet standard use, as discussed
                    in class.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Age Distribution in 1900 vs. 2000</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/a3_age_distribution.jpeg" width="100%" alt="age distribution" />
                <figcaption>
                    Age Distribution in 1900 vs. 2000
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I wanted to capture the movement of distribution over time better. I imagined that a gif over time
                    could move the 1900 "mountain" to meet the one of "2000".
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Overall</h3>
            <p>
                The question I wanted to answer is: did women live longer than men in 2000? How about in 1900?

            </p>

            <p>
                The three different visualizations target different focuses: whether the age distribution for men and
                women are symmetric, what the percentage of the senior population is made of women, and how women
                contributed to the shift in total age distribution over the two time instants. All three visualizations
                used size (either area or degree) to show the difference between the number of sexes. Only the last
                visualization integrates time in the visualization. All three visualizations deal with the challenge
                of coloring the genders (going against the pink and blue binary that has held throughout time).
