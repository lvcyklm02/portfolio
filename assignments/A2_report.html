			<h2>Subtheme: Speculative Investment</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What are different ways speculative investors make money?
					<p>
						This question stems from a confusion I had, when I thought flipping was the only way investors
						made money and then saw this "conflicting information" in the executive summary by Homes for
						Profit by the MPAC <a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/executive-summary">"Speculation and
							Investment in Greater Boston"</a>:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							"... investor activity is most likely to occur in the
							region’s high-density urban submarket with relatively low housing
							prices (Submarket 2)..."
						</li>
						<li>
							"While flips occurred at similar rates across submarkets, we found flipping to be most
							common in Greater Boston’s highest value submarket, Submarket 5."
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This language seems to suggest there was high activity in Submarket 2 that was NOT flipping, and
						was likely purchasing cheap houses and making rent higher for the low-income population. I am
						curious to know what the actual breakdown of activity is (including what percentage of
						investment activity is flips),
						and am curious to know if the data comes aggregated by it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>What are the profit margins of flipping different submarkets as a function of time?</li>
				<p>I am curious to know how investors gauge profitability, and why they tend towards suburban homes
					(Submarket 5) for flipping. Is it low risk high reward?
				</p>
				<li>How many houses are left unoccupied as a result of speculative investment?</li>
				<p>Out of personal experience: I have a friend that is quite successful in real-estate investments. She
					owns quite a few lands and houses around Asia, some of which are left unoccupied for most of the
					year. I wonder if there is a significant number of houses that are just always on Zillow but
					released by different owners. </p>
				<li>When will the housing prices go down? Will this scheme forever be profittable?</li>
				<p>The proposed solutions in the MAPC report are based on increased government regulation of real-estate
					transactions. If there are no such regualtions, what is the projected landscape of Boston in the
					next 20 years? Are we on a road to exponential growth of wealth inequality? Or will the bubble
					"burst" and are there any implications of this for independent home-owners and residents?</p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<h3>Property Usage Types </h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/usage_types.png" width="100%" alt="usage types" />
				<figcaption>
					The condominium was the most popular type of property that appeared over all transactions by a large
					margin. A condo is a "privately owned individual unit within a community of other units," according
					to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/what-is-a-condo/">Bankrate</a>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/non_condo_res_usage.png" width="100%" alt="residential non-condo usage types" />
				<figcaption>
					When zooming into the residential property types excluding the very popular condominium type, the
					next most popular usage types were family units and unit apartments.

				<figcaption>
					Geographical distribution of the property usage types. Limited to transactions from 2022. The figure
					displays a uniform popularity of condominiums and some concentrations of 1-family apartments in
					Beacon Hill and South End. And 4-8 unit apartments in the North End.

					Consistent popularity of condominium types in transaction.

			<h3>Flipped Properties</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/flip_freq.png" width="100%" alt="flip frequency" />
				<figcaption>
					When transactions were classified as flips, and divided into three time-based categories, most
					transactions were not flips, and of the flips, long-term flips were most frequent.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/all_transactions_2023.png" width="100%" alt="all transactions map" />
				<figcaption>
					Geographical distribution of all property transactions from 1/1/2022 to 12/31/2022 shows points all
					over Boston Area with a high concentration in the downtown area. (Edit: the figure should say 2022)

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/profitable_recent_residential_flips.png" width="100%" alt="recent profit map" />
				<figcaption>
					Highest profit residential flips in 2019-2022 were long-term flips around the Back Bay, South End,
					and Beacon Hill area.

			<h3>Trends in Time</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/price_of_homes.png" width="100%" alt="price of homes over time" />
				<figcaption>
					Prices have been rising for all properties, but the properties involved in investor-to-investor
					transactions specifically have increased in price much more substantially.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/profit.png" width="100%" alt="profit by time" />
				<figcaption>
					Likewise the median profit per transaction has increased throughout time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/flip_freq_time_relative.png" width="100%" alt="types of flips over time" />
				<figcaption>
					Between the different time terms of flips, the long-term flips became more popular starting in 2010
					and peaking in 2013.

				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>
					Boston real-estate in 2000-2022 can be characterized by consistent increase in the price of
					property.
					The most pervasive transaction type was the condominium, followed by 1-family residents and
					apartments. The popularity of condominium has stayed consistent since 2000. The popularity of
					of the rest of the residential property types have similarly stayed consistent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Homes for Profit article spotlighted the concern of speculative investments in Boston,
					specifically property flipping: defined as the act of selling a property less than two years of
					having bought it with the purpose of profit.
					Flipped properties make up only 3.75% of the 49,301 transactions recorded between 2000-2023.
					The flipped properties are mainly located in downtown Boston. The database aggregates the flipped
					properties by the time difference between the
					purchase and sell date: short (less than 6 months), medium (6 - 12 months), and long (12-24 months).
					The most frequent flip term was long-term, which seems to have risen to popularity starting 2010.
					The long-term flips also contained the more profittable
					residential flips (see Fig. 8), which were often located in Back Bay and South End.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, the data shows that the price of homes and profit per transaction projected to continue
					increasing. Without regulation, there likely will be no sudden decrease in prevalence of flipping.
					I could not deduct answers to my other original questions: how speculative investors make money
					outside of flipping, and what houses are left unoccupied (if any) during flipping processes.
