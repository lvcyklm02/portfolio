			<h2>Subtheme: Speculative Investment</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What are different ways speculative investors make money?
					<p>
						This question stems from a confusion I had, when I thought flipping was the only way investors
						made money and then saw this "conflicting information" in the executive summary:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							"... investor activity is most likely to occur in the
							region’s high-density urban submarket with relatively low housing
							prices (Submarket 2)..."
						</li>
						<li>
							"While flips occurred at similar rates across submarkets, we found flipping to be most
							common in Greater Boston’s highest value submarket, Submarket 5."
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This language seems to suggest there was high activity in Submarket 2 that was NOT flipping, and
						was likely purchasing cheap houses and making rent higher for the low-income population. I am
						curious to know what the actual breakdown of activity is (including what percentage of
						investment activity is flips),
						and am curious to know if the data comes aggregated by it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>What are the profit margins of flipping different submarkets as a function of time?</li>
				<p>I am curious to know how investors gauge profitability, and why they tend towards suburban homes
					(Submarket 5) for flipping. Is it low risk high reward?
				</p>
				<li>How many houses are left unoccupied as a result of speculative investment?</li>
				<p>Out of personal experience: I have a friend that is quite successful in real-estate investments. She
					owns quite a few lands and houses around Asia, some of which are left unoccupied for most of the
					year. I wonder if there is a significant number of houses that are just always on Zillow but
					released by different owners. </p>
				<li>When will the housing prices go down? Will this scheme forever be profittable?</li>
				<p>The proposed solutions in the MAPC report are based on increased government regulation of real-estate
					transactions. If there are no such regualtions, what is the projected landscape of Boston in the
					next 20 years? Are we on a road to exponential growth of wealth inequality? Or will the bubble
					"burst" and are there any implications of this for independent home-owners and residents?</p>
